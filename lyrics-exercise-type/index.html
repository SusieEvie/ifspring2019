						<p> 
						Hey there, Delilah <br>
						What's it like in New York city?<br>
						I'm a thousand miles away <br>
						But, girl, tonight you look so pretty <br>
						Yes, you do<br>
						Times Square can't shine as bright as you<br>
						I swear, it's true<br>
						<br>
						Hey there, Delilah<br>
						Don't you worry about the distance<br>
						I'm right there if you get lonely<br>
						Give this song another listen<br>
						Close your eyes<br>
						Listen to my voice, it's my disguise<br>
						I'm by your side<br>
						<p class="lyrics, chorus">
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							What you do to me<br>
						</p>
						Hey there, Delilah<br>
						I know times are gettin' hard<br>
						But just believe me, girl<br>
						Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar<br>
						We'll have it good<br>
						We'll have the life we knew we would<br>
						My word is good<br>
						<br>
						Hey there, Delilah<br>
						I've got so much left to say<br>
						If every simple song I wrote to you<br>
						Would take your breath away<br>
						I'd write it all<br>
						Even more in love with me you'd fall<br>
						We'd have it all<br>
						<p class="lyrics, chorus">
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
						</p>
						A thousand miles seems pretty far<br>
						But they've got planes and trains and cars<br>
						I'd walk to you if I had no other way<br>
						Our friends would all make fun of us<br>
						And we'd just laugh along because we'd know<br>
						That none of them have felt this way<br>
						Delilah, I can promise you<br>
						That by the time that we get through<br>
						The world will never ever be the same<br>
						And you're to blame<br>
						<br>
						Hey there, Delilah<br>
						You be good, and don't you miss me<br>
						Two more years and you'll be done with school<br>
						And I'll be makin' history like I do<br>
						You know it's all because of you<br>
						We can do whatever we want to<br>
						Hey there, Delilah, here's to you<br>
						This one's for you<br>
						<p class="lyrics, chorus">
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
							What you do to me, oh oh, woah, woah<br>
							Oh woah, oh<br>
							Oh
