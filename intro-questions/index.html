		<li>Hi! My name is Susannah Price, I am a senior majoring in architecture and minoring in art.</li> <br>
		<li>I have always been super into both design and engineering, I did science research in high school and got a little bit into computer science, but switched completely into the art side of things for college. I also have been working for over a year as a graphic designer, and web development seemed like a useful thing to add to my resume.</li><br>
		<li>I don't have any real experience with HTML, CSS, or JS, but I have a decent amount of experience with Java through some projects I did in high school.</li><br>
		<li>I would like to learn enough to be able to create a basic website and to be able to start teaching myself what else I need to know to become competent at web development.</li><br>
		<li>I expect it to be more dynamic and less static. Designing for paper seems to require very static solutions and attention to detail, but designing for screens requires adaptive solutions since your design is affected by so many different variables.</li><br>
		<li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"> Pinterest</a> is a site shows effective design. There are two main components to its design in my opinion: the inspirational aspect and the organizational aspect. The explore pages are the inspirational parts i my experience; they have easily expandable and never ending pages of images that represent many different creative ideas and make it seem like the options of what you can create are limitless, while the algorithm tailors these suggestions to things you're likely interested in so that you stay engaged while scrolling. The organizational component is the boards you can pin these images to. These boards can be secret or public and you can create as many as you want, and allow you to pin ideas the same way you might pin things to a physical corkboard. The visual aspect makes it feel very creative and intuitive, but there is an analytical aspect to the site that works behind the scenes that keeps things organized and makes it simple to find what you're looking for later or search through past projects or new images to guide your next project.</li><br>
		<li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> exemplifies effective communication because it has a bare bones but effective interface that is able to display a lot of information in an organized manner. The site makes pages editable by the community which creates a collborative environment allowing it to host as much information as possible instead of relying on one source for all of its information. It also makes effective use of hyperlinks to connect related ideas and direct you to another topic you may find interesting.</li><br>
		<li> I think that <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a> is a website that works super well. The design is sleek and is super consistent with its related apps, and is reactive to the dimensions of the browser. Aside from simply being a wesbite for viewing tv and movies, it has embedded subtle details such as the ability to skip intro sequences and multiple profiles in one account to suggest the right things for each person so that the individual viewer experience is altogether smooth. The design is intuitive and as long as you have good wifi it functions super well. </li>
