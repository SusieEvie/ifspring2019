From Michaela:
	⁃	The second page is super duper bright because of the yellow with white text. Visually a lot. I would use a darker background maybe? Or larger text? Unsure exactly what but def recommend changing
	⁃	Second page spacing between labels and body text is too even 
	⁃	-I would right justify page 3, easier to read, same thing with page 4 and the brightness is an issue like mentioned above
	⁃	Last page: it is hard to distinguish between the photo and white background. I would add a colored boarder to define
	⁃	Add swipe gesture for pages because dots are hard to click
