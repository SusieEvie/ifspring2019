		<li>The main feedback was to adjust the colors so there is more contrast between the text and background.</li>
		<li>I also need to make sure the header spacing looks even</li>
		<li>I intend to address the color concern by playing around with colors in my wireframe. I want it to be the yellow color scheme I have, but maybe I can do a yellow background with another color text or something</li>
		<li>I will adjust the text size so that the headers can look more uniform and all fit in the same space</li>
