		<p id="a">
		Hey there, Delilah <br>
		What's it like in New York city?<br>
		I'm a thousand miles away <br>
		But, girl, tonight you look so pretty <br>
		Yes, you do<br>
		Times Square can't shine as bright as you<br>
		I swear, it's true<br>
		</p>

		<p id="b">
		Hey there, Delilah<br>
		Don't you worry about the distance<br>
		I'm right there if you get lonely<br>
		Give this song another listen<br>
		Close your eyes<br>
		Listen to my voice, it's my disguise<br>
		I'm by your side<br>
		</p>

		<p id="c">
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		What you do to me<br>
		</p>

		<p id="d">
		Hey there, Delilah<br>
		I know times are gettin' hard<br>
		But just believe me, girl<br>
		Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar<br>
		We'll have it good<br>
		We'll have the life we knew we would<br>
		My word is good<br>
		</p>

		<p id="e">
		Hey there, Delilah<br>
		I've got so much left to say<br>
		If every simple song I wrote to you<br>
		Would take your breath away<br>
		I'd write it all<br>
		Even more in love with me you'd fall<br>
		We'd have it all<br>
		</p>

		<p id="f">
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		</p>

		<p id="g">
		A thousand miles seems pretty far<br>
		But they've got planes and trains and cars<br>
		I'd walk to you if I had no other way<br>
		Our friends would all make fun of us<br>
		And we'd just laugh along because we'd know<br>
		That none of them have felt this way<br>
		Delilah, I can promise you<br>
		That by the time that we get through<br>
		The world will never ever be the same<br>
		And you're to blame<br>
		</p>

		<p id="h">
		Hey there, Delilah<br>
		You be good, and don't you miss me<br>
		Two more years and you'll be done with school<br>
		And I'll be makin' history like I do<br>
		You know it's all because of you<br>
		We can do whatever we want to<br>
		Hey there, Delilah, here's to you<br>
		This one's for you<br>
		</p>

		<p id="i">
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		Oh, it's what you do to me<br>
		What you do to me, oh oh, woah, woah<br>
		Oh woah, oh<br>
		Oh
		</p>
