From Michaela:
	<ul>
		<li>The second page is super duper bright because of the yellow with white text. Visually a lot. I would use a darker background maybe? Or larger text? Unsure exactly what but def recommend changing </li>
		<li>Second page spacing between labels and body text is too even </li>
		<li>I would right justify page 3, easier to read, same thing with page 4 and the brightness is an issue like mentioned above</li>
		<li>Last page: it is hard to distinguish between the photo and white background. I would add a colored boarder to define</li>
		<li>Add swipe gesture for pages because dots are hard to click</li>
	</ul>
